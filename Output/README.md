# LobbyOffensiveNames

## Information

This mod lets you customise the base game terms which cause lobbies to not be visible when viewing the list of multiplayer servers. You can also completely disable the filter.

Note: This mod does not change anything if you have MoreCompany enabled as that mod currently doesn't include the lobby name filter, this is since the developer was initially unaware it existed due to it likely being added in v45.

## Changelog

### 1.0.1

- Added a bit of extra detail to the README.md
- Updated the icon
- Rather than force disabling the filter you can now configure what terms are blocked (the default value has slightly less terms than the original filter).

### 1.0.0

- Initial Release
